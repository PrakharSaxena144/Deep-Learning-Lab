# Deep-Learning-Lab

I will upload my college weekly assignments here related to Deep Learning

week1:
P1: Without using inbuilt functions: 1. Implement a perceptron from scratch for binary classification. Using the perceptron learning rule for training, classify linearly separable data (of your choice) and plot the decision boundary for the perceptron after training. 2. Implement XOR using network of perceptrons. Visualize the results.
